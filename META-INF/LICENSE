 party claims that Customer's use of the specific Broadcom Offering licensed
 or purchased by Customer under this Agreement infringes any valid US
patent or copyright within the jurisdictions where Customer is authorized to
 use the Broadcom Offering at the time of delivery provided that: (i)
Customer gives Broadcom prompt written notice thereof and reasonable
cooperation, information and assistance in connection therewith; (ii)
Broadcom shall have sole control and authority with respect to defense or
settlement thereof; and (iii) Customer takes no action that is contrary to
Broadcom's interest. Broadcom may, at its option and expense: (a) procure
for Customer the right to continue to use the Broadcom Offering; (b) repair,
 modify or replace the Broadcom Offering so that it is no longer infringing;
 or (c) provide a pro-rated refund of the fees paid for the Broadcom

indemnity calculated against the remainder of the Term from the date it is
established that Broadcom is notified of the third party claim. If the
Broadcom Offering is Broadcom Software, and is licensed on a perpetual
basis, an amortization schedule of three (3) years shall be used for the
basis of the refund calculation.
8.2. Broadcom shall have no liability: (i) in the event the allegation of
infringement is a result of a modification of the Broadcom Offering except a
 modification by Broadcom, (ii) if the Broadcom Offering is not being used
in accordance with Broadcom's specifications, related documentation and
guidelines, (iii) if the alleged infringement would be avoided or otherwise
 eliminated by the use of a Broadcom published update or patch, (iv) if the
alleged infringement is a result of use of the Broadcom Offerings in
combination with any third party product, (v) any Deliverable provided by
Broadcom in accordance with Customer's specifications, (vi) any claim
relating to open source software or freeware technology that is not
embedded by Broadcom into the Broadcom Offerings, (vii) any Broadcom
Offering provided on a no-charge, beta, or evaluation basis, or (viii) if
the applicable fees due for the specific Transaction Document have not been
paid or Customer is otherwise in breach of this Agreement. The
indemnifications contained herein shall not apply and Broadcom shall have
no liability in relation to any Broadcom Offering produced by Broadcom at
the specific direction of Customer. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, THE FOREGOING PROVISIONS STATE THE ENTIRE LIABILITY AND
OBLIGATIONS OF BROADCOM REGARDING CLAIMS OF INFRINGEMENT, AND THE EXCLUSIVE
REMEDY AVAILABLE TO CUSTOMER WITH RESPECT TO ANY ACTUAL OR ALLEGED
INFRINGEMENT OR MISAPPROPRIATION OF ANY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OR OTHER
PROPRIETARY RIGHTS.
8.3. Each Party shall indemnify the other against all damages, fees,
(including reasonable attorney's fees) fines, judgments, costs and expenses

infringes any US patent, copyright, or trademark within the jurisdictions

SAVED OR FEES GENERATED AND OR ANY LOSS OF CUSTOMER DATA BY USE OF ANY
BROADCOM OFFERING, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER A PARTY WAS APPRISED OF THE
POTENTIAL FOR SUCH DAMAGES; AND B) IN NO EVENT WILL A PARTY'S LIABILITY FOR
DIRECT DAMAGES, EXCEED TWO TIMES THE AMOUNTS PAID BY CUSTOMER FOR THE
BROADCOM OFFERING THAT GAVE RISE TO THE BREACH IN THE TWELVE MONTHS PRIOR

UNDER THE AGREEMENT, AND CUSTOMER MAY NOT BRING CLAIMS DIRECTLY AGAINST
THEM. BROADCOM'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR AN EVALUATION WILL NOT EXCEED

10. TERM & TERMINATION
10.1. This Foundation Agreement shall continue in effect unless otherwise
terminated in accordance with this section.
10.2. This Foundation Agreement, applicable Module(s), and the applicable
Transaction Document may be terminated by either Party (a) upon a material
breach by the other Party, provided that, in each instance of a claimed
breach: (i) the non-breaching Party notifies the breaching Party in writing
of such breach; and (ii) the breaching Party fails to cure such breach
within thirty (30) days (or such other period as mutually agreed by the
Parties) from receipt of such notice; (b) upon insolvency of the other
Party, if permitted by law. The foregoing notwithstanding, any breach by
Customer of licenses or rights granted pursuant to this Agreement will
constitute an incurable material breach by Customer; and, Broadcom may
immediately terminate all of Customer's use rights and licenses,
(subscription-based, perpetual, access, and use), upon written notice to
Customer, and Customer must either: a) delete all full or partial copies of
the Broadcom Software and SaaS instances from all computing or storage
equipment and verify such deletion in a statement signed by a Vice-President
 or a duly authorized representative sent to usage.reporting@broadcom.com,
or b) return to Broadcom all full or partial copies of the Broadcom
Software. Such termination shall not relieve Customer from its obligations
as set forth within the related Transaction Document.
10.3. Termination does not release either Party from any liability which, at
 the time of such termination, had already accrued to the other Party or
which is attributable to a period prior to such termination, nor preclude
either Party from pursuing any rights or remedies it may have under law or
in equity with respect to any breach of this Foundation Agreement or the
Agreement. In the event of termination by Broadcom for an uncured material
breach by Customer, all fees shall immediately become due and payable.
10.4. Customer may terminate this Agreement provided that Customer also
terminates each and all other agreements (direct or indirect, whether or not
 related to this Agreement) under which Customer may procure any Broadcom
Offerings (but in all cases excluding any hardware offerings and associated
support contracts therefor) together with each and all Orders (however
titled) in effect (except in the case of the VMware product family, only
Orders entered into after November 21, 2023 need to be terminated)
between the parties as of the date of termination (collectively, for
purposes of this section, the "Agreements"), without cause and without
further charge or expense at any time, immediately upon written notice to
Broadcom sent to usage.reporting@broadcom.com.
On or after the termination date, with the exception of any Fully Paid-Up
perpetual licenses (where the amount of "Fully Paid-Up" licenses will equal
the total whole number of licenses earned prior to the termination and are
assumed to be paid for equally over the initial term of the associated
Support Services), Customer must either: a) delete all full or partial
copies of the Broadcom Software from all computing or storage equipment,
and verify such deletion in a statement signed by a Vice-President or a duly
 authorized representative and sent to usage.reporting@broadcom.com, or b)
return to Broadcom all full or partial copies of the Broadcom Software.
Once Customer's verification or the Broadcom Software copies are received,
Broadcom will pay Customer, or Broadcom Partner, a pro-rata refund of any
License, SaaS/Cloud Service, Support Services, or other fees Customer or
Broadcom Partner pre-paid ("Refund Fees") in accordance with the paragraph
below. Refund Fees will be calculated on the number of days remaining in
the term (which for the purposes of this calculation will be deemed to
commence from the date Customer's verification or the Broadcom Software
copies are received) of the offering eligible for the refund. If the
Broadcom Software is licensed as a perpetual license and the associated
Support Services is in its initial term, Customer, or Broadcom Partner as
appropriate, will receive a pro-rated refund of the cash consideration paid
to Broadcom based on the initial payment schedule and shall be entitled to
keep the whole number of perpetual licenses Fully Paid-Up through such
date, absent language to the contrary in the applicable order.
10.5. Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraph, if the Agreement is
terminated without cause, neither Party shall have further obligations under
 the Agreement, except that the Parties shall remain bound by the
obligations within the survival sections of the Agreements. Refund Fees will
 be paid within sixty (60) days to Customer (or Broadcom Partner who will
process the invoicing or reimbursement of fees to Customer as appropriate
and under the commercial terms between the Broadcom Partner and
Customer), from the date Customer's verification or the Broadcom Software
copies are received, and any unpaid fees reflecting the Broadcom Offerings
delivered prior to the termination date shall become immediately due.

PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. THE ACCOMPANYING SOFTWARE
DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DESCRIBING THE SOFTWARE;
BROADCOM DISCLAIMS ANY REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OR OTHER BROADCOM
COMMITMENTS, OBLIGATIONS, OR LIABILITIES, IN SUCH SOFTWARE.
4. HARDWARE OFFERING AND OBLIGATIONS
4.1. The Hardware provided to Customer pursuant to a Transaction
Document is to be used only with the Broadcom Software that is
pre-installed or delivered for installation. Subject to Customer's
compliance with this Agreement, Broadcom permits Customer to use the
Hardware solely with the Broadcom Software preinstalled or delivered for
installation in support of Customer's internal business operations.
4.2. Certain Hardware requires Customer to register a service tag prior to
use in the location Customer intends to use the Hardware ("Geographic Use
Location"). In the event Customer wishes to change Customer's Geographic
Use Location, Customer may do so at no additional cost but must contact
Broadcom support to re-register the Hardware tag. Any change to the
Geographic Use Location and/or any service request that requires Broadcom
to obtain additional information and/or validate information to acknowledge
and approve warranty service entitlements may result in a delay in providing
 warranty service entitlements.
4.3. Broadcom will provide a replacement unit for any Hardware that fails to
 operate in accordance to published configuration and technical
specifications within the first three (3) business days after installation,
provided that such installation must be completed within thirty (30) days
from the date of shipment. Failure to operate does not include cosmetic or
other defects that do not directly affect the Hardware's performance. Units
which fail to operate must be identified as such by either a Broadcom
technical support engineer or an authorized Broadcom representative. A new,
like-model replacement unit will be shipped using commercially reasonable
means to ship the replacement Hardware. Broadcom will aim to ship within
five (5) business days from receipt of notification of product failure,
subject to product availability. Delivery is dependent on destination and
may be impacted by delays in customs that are beyond the control of
Broadcom or its carriers. Customer is responsible for reading and complying
with the return instructions included with the replacement Hardware.
Broadcom shall not be responsible for any software, firmware, information or
 data provided by Customer or a third party that is contained in, stored on,
 or integrated with, any hardware component returned to Broadcom for
repair or replacement, whether or not under warranty.

the guidelines at:
https://support.broadcom.com/web/ecx/support-content-notification/-/extern
al/content/release-announcements/CA-Support-Policies/6933 (or successor
URL). If a renewal fee for Maintenance is identified on a Transaction
Document, then Broadcom may automatically invoice Customer for such
renewal unless Broadcom receives not less than thirty (30) days written
notice from Customer prior to the anniversary of the applicable Term that
such Maintenance is not desired.
5.2. If Content Updates are included as part of Maintenance, Customer is
granted the right to receive and use Content Updates as and when they are
made generally available, for the Maintenance term, and only for the
quantity, indicated on the applicable Transaction Document(s). This
Agreement does not otherwise give Customer the right to obtain or use
Content Updates, and any unauthorized access to or use of Content Updates
is deemed a breach of this Agreement. Upon expiration or termination of the
Maintenance Term, Customer must uninstall any Software component that
facilitates the receipt of Content Updates and use of Content Updates after
expiration or termination of the Maintenance term is a material breach of
this License Agreement.
5.3. Software Updates/Upgrades, as provided pursuant to guidelines, may
only be obtained for the Authorized Use Limitation or quantity indicated in
the applicable Transaction Document. Any Software Updates/Upgrades to an
existing license do not modify or alter Customer's Authorized Use Limitation
 or quantity. If Customer is permitted to transfer its licenses to a
different Broadcom Software title, then Customer may receive a new
Transaction Document on the condition that Customer cease using the
replaced Broadcom Software prior to use of such replacement Broadcom
Software. Software Updates/Upgrades are subject to the then-current version
of this agreement.

8. SOFTWARE PERFORMANCE WARRANTY REMEDY
8.1. If Broadcom has breached either warranty set forth in the section
entitled: Performance Warranty, Customer's remedy is for Broadcom to, in
consultation with Customer, to either (i) use reasonable efforts consistent
with industry standards to cure the defect, or (ii) replace the Broadcom
Software(s) with one that materially complies with the Documentation, or
(iii) terminate the license and provide a prorata refund of the license fees
 paid and or Support fees. To Customer or Broadcom Partner (wherefrom the
non-compliant Broadcom Offering was procured). If option (iii) applies, the
pro-rata refund shall be calculated on the number of months left remaining
on the Term of the applicable Transaction Document or if the Broadcom
Software is licensed under Perpetual License, using (only for purposes of a
refund calculation) an amortization schedule of three (3) years. The above
warranty remedies are Broadcom's sole obligation and Customer's sole and
exclusive remedy for the breach of the above warranty.
8.2. Warranty remedies are conditioned upon (i) any error or defect reported
 is reasonably reproducible by Broadcom, (ii) the Broadcom Software is not
modified and is being used in accordance with Broadcom Documentation,
and (iii) the breach is not attributable in whole or in part to any
non-Broadcom product(s) or service(s).
